# Telugu Tokenizer

## Project Description

Telugu Tokenizer is a project designed to tokenize Telugu text using Sentencepiece. The tokenizer is trained on a dataset of Telugu books, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and contextual understanding of the language.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the tokenizer consists of a comprehensive collection of Telugu books and Telugu news. This extensive dataset allows the tokenizer to learn and generalize well across different styles and contexts of Telugu text.

## Hugging Face App

Check out our Hugging Face app for the Telugu Tokenizer [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kartheekb7/telugu_toekenizer).

## Training Methodology

The Telugu Tokenizer is trained using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm. BPE is a subword segmentation algorithm that allows the model to handle the complex morphology of the Telugu language effectively by breaking down words into subword units.

### Compression Ratio

One of the key metrics for evaluating the performance of our tokenizer is the compression ratio. This measures how well the tokenizer compresses the input text, which is an indicator of its efficiency and effectiveness. compression ratio achevied is 3.27
